# Text-Based-Adventure-Game-on-Python

This is a Python Adventure Game based off the tutorial done by Philip Johnson called
"Make Your Own Python Text Adventure". All credits to the concept of the game to 
Philip Johnson. I am using Philip Johnson's tutorial to gain a better understanding and summary of differeny Python skills. 



Concept of the game:
This game takes place in a cave with your goal of escaping alive.
